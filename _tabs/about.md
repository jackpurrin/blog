## this website

well this website was born a couple months ago i belive. i can not name exactly when, i will add that later, but it has been a long time. 

i have this website because i love writing, i really do! and sometimes (a lot actually) i have a lot going on in my head, so i like to write to get it out. i usually write my ideas and stuff in my second brain i call ["logseq"](https://logseq.com). it has helped me clear my mind out a lot! but besides the point. the bigger thoughts and the ones i really wanna write about get put in this website, so that is why this website exists.
